# Obstacle-avoidance-with-F.S.M-Finite-State-Machines-Using-ROS-2
This repository shows a robot which is able to avoid obstacles using a finite state machine,this is a very important field or aspect of mobile robotics. A back bone of autonomous control,as this makes or allow a robot be ale to reach it's destination without collusion.This algorithm is widely/mostly used in path planning.


# OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE USING F.S.M ROS 2.
The robot is able to detect an object in front of it,using the finite state machine procedure.
